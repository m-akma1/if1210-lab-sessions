# IF1210 Lab Session Archive

## Course Overview

Welcome! If you find this repo is useful, there's a chance that you're an informatics student at ITB looking for last year's lab archive. **IF1210 Algorithm and Programming 1** (2024 Curriculum) is the first _actual_ programming course (aside from [WI1102](https://github.com/m-akma1/wi1102-lab-sessions)) offered for informatics (IF), information system and technology (II), and electrical engineering (EL) students at Semester 2. The first half of the course talks about the overview of programming paradigms then specializing in procedural programming and the "best practice" when writing a code. The second half of it discusses data structures: structs, lists, set, map, stack, queue, linked list, and their basic implementation. 

### "Notal" Review

All lectures and exams use a form of _pseudocode_ called "notasi algoritma" or _notal_ for short. They said it was the "general" and inclusive form to knows the code without relying on specific language, while actually it's just Pascal and ADA meshed with Python's indentation rules. It's a mess, and somehow the lecturers are proud of it. They stick on it even when the code is highly unefficient and long, just for the sake of "consistency" and "readibility". Majority of the students spite it, but can't do anything to defy it since that notation is a "legacy system" and has been used since 1998 (make sense since that time ADA and Pascal are still popular). 

From then, the notation has been modified, or I personally say plastered and plugged with, various elements and syntax that specific to some language to the point where it became a new programming language itself. Heck, one my friend even try to create a "notal generator" where you can convert or compile notal code. Picture this: the notation has 5 different loop templates, and almost all of them are used in a highly specific scenario to the point where it has no use outside of the course. The notal, when this course is offered has: the syntax and keywords of Pascal, the indentation rules of Python and Ada, the data structures of C (of course with pointers), whilst also ignoring the fact that it must use an *actual arrow* (the unicode version: ←, ↑, →, ↓) when typing it.

## Lab Sessions

### Overal Review

The lab uses C, which is perfect for procedural programming, but horrible for beginners. For a typical student that just learns Python from the previous semester, C is hell. They don't know about setting up compilers, pointers, or even a segmentation fault. The materials doesn't even talks about it, you need to learn it all by yourself. And if that's not enough, the labs are held weekly and starts diving into competitive programming problems. There are one more plot twist: the autograder system is trash. It's too strict to the point where whitespace character must be exactly the same with the solution's output. The web server is worse: it loads too slow, grades too slow, and often randomly times out. It became too much of problem to the point where student uses almost 10-15% of the time given to wait for the website. 

### Materials Overview

There are 10 labs in total, each held weekly except for national holidays and exams week. Each lab has 3-5 problems with varying difficulty (not sorted). The labs format are pair programming with only one laptop (or triple when the number of students are odd) allowed. For each session, we are given 100 minutes to solve all of the problems. The submissions are graded automatically with an autograder similar to a competitive programming format. To get a full score, you need to pass all the test cases with an AC (Accepted) verdict. If you get a WA, RTE, TLE, or even CE, goodluck debugging it. 

For a competitive programming veteran, these labs should be trivial, if not for the fact that some problems are "problematic": unclear problem statement, wrong test case, revisions, and even straight up wrong solution key. No wonder the labs average grade is very low. But hey, I understand how hard it is to be a problem setter, so kudos for the TAs for the dedications. My suggestions, for the beginners is to learn the basic of competitive programming, try solve some problem in TLX, Codeforces, Leetcode, Atcoder, or else whilst also learn the syntax and nature of C.
